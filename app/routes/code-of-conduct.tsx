            <ul class="list-disc px-6 space-y-1.5">
              <li>
                <strong>Respecting boundaries</strong>: If someone says "no,"
                "stop," or physically disengages, the transaction is void.
                Continuing to push—whether for a debate, a pitch, or a chat—is a
                violation of the non-aggression principle..
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assume Zero Consent</strong>: Do not touch anyone
                without explicit permission. Do not photograph anyone wearing a
                "no photo" indicator where we have them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scope</strong>: This applies to all venues,
                afterparties, and the official digital channels.

            <p class="pb-2">
              Attention is the scarcest resource out here now. Do not steal it.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc px-6 space-y-1.5">
              <li>
                <strong>Signal vs noise</strong>: Do not corner people to pitch
                your tokens. Aggressive shilling is taxes on our collective
                cognitive load. Engage on fundamental engineering or philosophy
                and let price talk in the market.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Recruitment</strong>: Headhunting is acceptable;
                pestering builders in the flow state is not. Read the room.

              <li>
                <strong>Property rights</strong>: Never touch another person's
                keyboard or unlocked laptop (or anything not explicitly yours,
                really). Building trustless systems does not absolve us of the
                need for physical integrity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>The Commons</strong>: Minimize your negative
                externalities. Respect the space(s) that you occupy. Leave the
                environment in a better condition than you found it.

              The decentralized future requires each of us to be capable of
              self-regulation. Do not force us to be the leviathan.

                in immediate, permanent exclusion.

                <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>: In the event of a dispute,
